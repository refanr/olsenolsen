# The Great Olsen Olsen Project


## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create a simulator and an AI agent for the game commonly known in Iceland as 'Olsen Olsen', it is similar to the game 'Switch', or 'Blackjack Switch'. The start of the project is to implement the simulator for the game itself, to model the environment for the agent to train on. For this, I will consult other projects and labs I have worked on in T-622-ARTI and probably T-504-ITML as well.

## Methods

The actual implementation of the environment, state representation and the implementation of the Monte Carlo Search Tree was inspired by the mctsc4 (Monte Carlo Tree Search Connect 4) from https://github.com/HarryWangATX
